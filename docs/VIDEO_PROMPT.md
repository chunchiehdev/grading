## PROJECT VISION & MISSION

### The Problem (Story Opening)
Every day, educators face an overwhelming challenge: **grading hundreds of assignments while managing multiple classes**. Teachers spend countless hours:
- Manually reviewing student submissions
- Writing repetitive feedback on similar mistakes
- Organizing rubrics across different courses
- Struggling to provide timely feedback that students can actually use

Meanwhile, students are frustrated by:
- Long waiting periods for grading results
- Vague or inconsistent feedback
- Not understanding WHERE they went wrong
- Limited opportunities to improve based on constructive comments

**This is where GradeGenius comes in.**
